Welcome to Fantasy FRC! This guide will help you understand what fantasy FRC is and how to get started playing.

## 🤔 What is Fantasy FRC?

Fantasy FRC is a fantasy league game for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), similar to fantasy football but with FRC teams instead of NFL players. You'll:

- **Draft FRC teams** during a live draft with other players
- **Earn points** based on how your teams perform in real FRC competitions
- **Compete against friends** to see who can build the best fantasy team portfolio
- **Follow along** during championship events to track your teams' success

### The Concept
Just like in traditional fantasy sports, you become a "team owner" who selects a portfolio of real FRC teams. Your fantasy score is the sum of all your drafted teams' actual competition performance scores.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Join or Create a League
- **Join an existing draft**: Accept an invitation from a friend
- **Create your own draft**: Set up a new league and invite others
- **8 players per draft**: Standard league size for optimal competition

### 2. Participate in the Live Draft
- **Snake draft order**: Pick order reverses each round (1→8→8→1...)
- **8 teams per player**: You'll draft 8 FRC teams total
- **Time limits**: Each pick has a time limit to keep drafts moving
- **Real-time updates**: Watch other players' picks as they happen

### 3. Follow Championship Events
- **Championship focus**: Scoring is based on FRC Championship performance
- **Multiple events**: Teams compete across various championship divisions
- **Real-time scoring**: Watch your score update as matches complete

### 4. Win the League
- **Highest score wins**: The player with the most points at the end wins
- **Strategy matters**: Team selection and draft order are crucial
- **Bragging rights**: Compete for the title of best FRC strategist
