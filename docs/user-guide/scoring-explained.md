# Scoring Explained

Understanding how teams (and your fantasy roster) earn points is key to Fantasy FRC success. This guide breaks down the scoring system in simple terms.

## 🎯 Scoring Overview

Each FRC team you draft earns points based on their actual performance during championship events. Your fantasy score is simply the sum of all your drafted teams' points.

### Basic Formula
```
Your Score = Team 1 Points + Team 2 Points + ... + Team 8 Points
```

### Team Score Breakdown
Each team's total comes from four main components:
1. **Qualification Score** - Performance in early matches
2. **Playoff Score** - Elimination round performance  
3. **Alliance Score** - Championship alliance selection
4. **Einstein Score** - Einstein Championship performance (double points!)

## 📊 The Four Score Components

### 1. Qualification Score ("Qual Score")
Points earned during qualification matches at championships.

**How it Works:**
- **Win** = 3 base points
- **Loss/Tie** = 0 points
- **Game Bonuses** = Additional points (varies by year's game)

**Example Match:**
- Team wins match + achieves 2 bonus objectives
- Points: 3 (win) + 1 (bonus 1) + 1 (bonus 2) = 5 points

**Why it Matters:**
- Most matches played = most scoring opportunities
- Consistent teams rack up points here
- Foundation of a team's total score

### 2. Playoff Score  
Points earned in elimination rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, finals).

**Point Values by Round:**
- **Semifinals**: 15 points (upper bracket) or 9 points (lower bracket)
- **Finals**: 18 points
- **Quarterfinals**: 0 points (participation only)

**Bracket Explanation:**
- **Upper Bracket**: Teams that win their first quarterfinal series
- **Lower Bracket**: Teams that lose first but fight back through elimination

**Example:**
- Team wins semifinal in upper bracket = 15 points
- Same team loses finals = 0 additional points
- Total playoff score = 15 points

### 3. Alliance Score  
Points based on where teams get selected during championship alliance selection.

**How Alliance Selection Works:**
1. Top 8 teams become "alliance captains"
2. Each captain picks 3 other teams to join their alliance
3. Selection order matters for scoring

**Scoring Table (Base Values):**
| Alliance Position | Captain | 1st Pick | 2nd Pick | 3rd Pick |
|------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1st Alliance     | 64      | 62       | 18       | 16       |
| 2nd Alliance     | 60      | 58       | 20       | 14       |
| 3rd Alliance     | 56      | 54       | 22       | 12       |
| 4th Alliance     | 52      | 50       | 24       | 10       |
| 5th Alliance     | 48      | 46       | 26       | 8        |
| 6th Alliance     | 44      | 42       | 28       | 6        |
| 7th Alliance     | 40      | 38       | 30       | 4        |
| 8th Alliance     | 36      | 34       | 32       | 2        |

**Important:** All alliance scores are **doubled** from the table values!

**Example:**
- Team gets picked as 2nd pick by 3rd alliance
- Base value: 54 points
- Final score: 54 × 2 = 108 points

### 4. Einstein Score  
Special scoring for the Einstein Championship (the ultimate final).

**How it Works:**
- Same scoring as regular playoffs
- **ALL POINTS ARE DOUBLED**
- Only applies to Einstein Championship matches

**Example Einstein Scoring:**
- Regular semifinal win: 15 points
- Einstein semifinal win: 15 × 2 = 30 points

## 🏆 Championship Events Explained
