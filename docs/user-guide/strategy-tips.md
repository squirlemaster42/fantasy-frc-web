Ready to dominate your Fantasy FRC league? These strategies will help you build a winning team and outsmart your competition.

## 🎯 Core Strategy Principles

### 1. Alliance Selection is King
**Why it matters:** Alliance selection scores are often the biggest point contributor for any team.

**Key Insights:**
- **Alliance captains** can earn 100+ points just from being selected
- **Early picks** (1st, 2nd) score significantly more than later picks
- **Being selected** is more valuable than winning some playoff matches

**Strategy Impact:**
- Prioritize teams likely to be alliance captains
- Don't underestimate mid-tier teams that get picked early
- A team that loses all matches but gets picked 2nd can outscore a team that wins a quarterfinal

### 2. Balance Risk and Reward
**Safe Picks:**
- Historically strong programs (Team 254, 118, 1678, etc.)
- Teams that consistently qualify for championships
- Veteran teams with proven track records

**High-Value Risks:**
- Up-and-coming teams on the rise
- Teams with strong early-season performance
- Rookies with exceptional early results

**Strategy Mix:**
- **2-3 elite teams** (safe, high-floor)
- **3-4 solid contributors** (moderate risk/reward)  
- **1-2 sleepers** (high upside)

### 3. Don't Chase Early-Season Hype
**The Trap:**
- Early tournament winners might not peak at championships
- Game-specific advantages can change between events
- Some teams sandbag or hold back strategies

**Better Approach:**
- Look for teams with consistent, not spectacular, early performance
- Consider teams that improve over the season
- Factor in historical championship performance

## 📊 Draft Position Strategy

### Early Picks (1-3): Build Your Foundation

**Your Advantage:**
- Access to the most elite, safe options
- Can lock in guaranteed high-point teams

**Strategy:**
1. **Pick 1-2 elite alliance captains**: Almost guaranteed 100+ points
2. **Consider floor over ceiling**: Safe 120-point pick > risky 180-point pick
3. **Don't overthink**: The obvious elite choices are usually right

**Example First Picks:**
- Teams that consistently make finals or win divisions
- Historically strong programs (check championship history)
- Teams with strong early results against good competition

### Middle Picks (4-6): Value Hunting

**The Challenge:**
- Elite teams are gone
- Need to find undervalued options

**Strategy:**
1. **Target reliable mid-tier teams**: Teams that consistently qualify
2. **Look for specialists**: Teams that excel at current game elements
3. **Consider division balance**: Don't load up on teams from one division

**Value Indicators:**
- Teams that consistently make quarterfinals/semifinals
- Strong alliance selection candidates (not just captains)
- Teams with good scouting reports on robot capabilities

### Late Picks (7-8): High Upside Targets

**Your Approach:**
- Can't compete with early picks on safe options
- Must take calculated risks

**Strategy:**
1. **Shoot for breakout teams**: Teams that could surprise everyone
2. **Consider division cappers**: One elite team from each division
3. **Don't be afraid to reach**: Take the team you believe in

**High-Upside Targets:**
- Strong rookie teams with exceptional early results
- Teams that dramatically improved between events
- Teams with unique robot designs that could be advantageous

## 🏆 Team Evaluation Framework

### 1. Historical Performance Analysis

**Championship History:**
- How many times has this team qualified for championships?
- What's their best-ever championship finish?
- Do they consistently make playoffs or alliance selection?

**Recent Years (3-5 year trend):**
- Are they getting better or worse over time?
- Any major changes in team resources/sponsorship?
- Consistency vs. boom-or-bust performance?

**Red Flags:**
- One-year wonders without follow-up success
- Teams with declining performance trends
- Teams that regularly underperform at championships

### 2. Current Season Assessment

**Early Season Results:**
- Event wins and finalist appearances
- Quality of competition (strength of events attended)
- Any dominant performances?

**Performance Trends:**
- Improving throughout the season (good sign)
- Peaking early then declining (warning sign)
- Consistent performance across multiple events

**Game-Specific Factors:**
- How well does their robot design match this year's game?
- Are they strong at the highest-point game elements?
- Any specialized capabilities that could be game-changing?

### 3. Intangible Factors

**Team Resources:**
- Well-funded programs often have advantages
- Teams with multiple mentors/engineers
- Strong school/community support

**Team Culture:**
- Known for good strategy and alliance selection decisions
- Teams that perform well under pressure
- Programs with sustained success over many years

**Scouting Intelligence:**
- What are other teams saying about them?
- Any inside information on robot capabilities?
- Reputation for being a good alliance partner

## 🎮 Advanced Draft Strategies

### The "Captain Stack"
**Theory:** Draft multiple teams likely to be alliance captains.

**How it Works:**
- Use early picks on 2-3 teams that will be top 8 seeds
- These teams each bring 100+ points from alliance selection
- Accept lower playoff performance for guaranteed alliance points

**When to Use:**
- You have early draft picks
- Strong pool of clear elite teams
- Current game emphasizes alliance selection scoring

### The "Division Hedge"
**Theory:** Spread picks across multiple championship divisions.

**How it Works:**
- Pick 1-2 teams from each major division
- Increases chance of having teams in playoffs of multiple divisions
- Reduces risk of one division being unexpectedly weak

**Benefits:**
- Diversifies scoring opportunities
- Ensures you have teams playing throughout championship weekend
- Reduces impact of one division's poor performance

### The "Specialist Focus"
**Theory:** Target teams that excel at specific high-point game elements.

**How it Works:**
- Identify the most valuable scoring opportunities in this year's game
- Target teams specifically built to excel at those elements
- Value specialization over being well-rounded

**Example Applications:**
- If autonomous scoring is highly valuable, draft teams with elite auto routines
- If endgame scoring matters most, target teams known for reliable endgame

### The "Rookie Gamble"
**Theory:** Invest in high-potential rookie teams.

**How it Works:**
- Identify 1-2 exceptional rookie teams
- These teams often exceed expectations
- Low draft cost for potential high ceiling

**Success Indicators:**
- Won or dominated early events
- Strong robot design and execution
- Good team resources despite being rookie

## 📈 In-Draft Decision Making

### When Your Target Gets Picked
**Don't Panic Strategy:**
1. **Move to backup plan**: You should have 2-3 alternatives ready
2. **Re-evaluate board**: Recent picks may have changed team values
3. **Consider adjacents**: Teams similar to your target
4. **Stick to strategy**: Don't abandon your overall approach

### When Unexpected Runs Happen
**Recognition:**
- Notice when multiple teams of similar type get picked quickly
- This often signals experienced drafters see value you missed

**Adjustment Options:**
- **Join the run**: If you agree with the strategy, pick similar team
- **Go contrarian**: Pick different type of team for balance
- **Wait it out**: Let the run pass, value may return later

### Time Management Under Pressure
**Quick Decision Framework:**
1. **Top 3 targets**: Always have 3 teams ranked for each pick
2. **Point projection**: Rough mental calculation of each team's potential
3. **Risk assessment**: Quick evaluation of each option's risk/reward
4. **Trust your research**: Don't abandon weeks of preparation for 30-second panic

## 🔄 Post-Draft Strategy

### Monitoring Your Teams
**What to Watch:**
- **Division assignments**: Which championship are they actually in?
- **Early qualification matches**: How do they look in practice?
- **Alliance selection predictions**: Where might they actually get picked?

**Active Management:**
- Watch division assignments (can change team values)
- Follow practice/scouting reports
- Adjust expectations based on early championship performance

### Rooting Strategy
**Division rooting interests:**
- Teams in same division: They compete against each other
- Teams in different divisions: Can all succeed simultaneously

**Ideal scenarios:**
- Your teams spread across divisions for maximum scoring
- Multiple teams making deep playoff runs
- Several teams getting good alliance selection positions

## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Overvaluing Early Tournament Wins
**The Mistake:** Drafting teams just because they won early events.

**Why it's Wrong:**
- Early tournaments may have weaker competition
- Game strategies evolve between events
- Some teams peak early and fade at championships

**Better Approach:** Look for teams that show improvement and adapt well.

### 2. Ignoring Division Balance
**The Mistake:** Drafting 4-5 teams from the same division.

**Why it's Wrong:**
- Limits your scoring opportunities (they compete against each other)
- Increases risk if that division is unexpectedly weak
- Reduces championship weekend engagement

**Better Approach:** Spread teams across 3-4 different divisions.

### 3. Focusing Only on "Big Names"
**The Mistake:** Only drafting famous FRC teams.

**Why it's Wrong:**
- Big names are often overdrafted
- Many less famous teams outperform them
- You miss value opportunities

**Better Approach:** Consider all teams objectively, including rising programs.

### 4. Forgetting About Bonus Points
**The Mistake:** Ignoring game-specific bonus scoring opportunities.

**Why it's Wrong:**
- Bonus points can add up significantly
- Some teams are built specifically to maximize bonuses
- These points are often more predictable than playoff performance

**Better Approach:** Identify which teams excel at high-value game elements.

## 🏆 Championship Weekend Viewing

### Optimal Viewing Schedule
**Focus on your teams:**
- Track when each team plays qualification matches
- Know their division's playoff schedule
- Plan to watch alliance selection for all divisions

**Score tracking:**
- Monitor your dashboard for real-time updates
- Understand how each match impacts your total
- Watch for unexpected score changes

### Enjoying the Experience
- **Celebrate your teams' successes**: That's why you drafted them!
- **Learn for next year**: Take notes on what worked and didn't
- **Engage with your league**: Chat with other players about performances
